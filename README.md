# EFDC-GVC
Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code - Generalized Vertical Coordinate 

DSI has made the Generalized Vertical Coordinate (GVC) version of EFDC code available. EFDC-GVC code refers to the code that was developed and previously was provided by US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). EPA stopped providing the source code for EFDC several years ago.  DSI has modified the EFDC-GVC code to work with EEMS.  The code has also been modified to correct bugs found.  DSI provides this updated version of the source code for the modeling community that is looking to upgrade legacy modeling applications to DSIâ€™s EFDC+.  Many legacy models still use older version of the EFDC code and need an open source version for their testing.  DSI recommends that users not use the GVC code for on-going models and make the conversion to EFDC+.

Please do note that this code is provided as-is without any support.
